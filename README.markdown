# Compass SASS Stylesheets
This repository is fork of 
[original repository](https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins), intented to fix errors with new sass syntax.

## Compass Ruby Functions

This project includes reasonably similar implementations of some of the Ruby functions that Compass provides as Sass extensions. These are used in some Compass mixins, such as `@include background()`.

To make those functions available to your compass mixins, you'll want to either `@import "compass";` or `@import "compass/functions"'` before the specific compass scss files you import.
